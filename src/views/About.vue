    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>This application was a tutorial with Traversy Media. It is
      thorough in its explanation of Vue.js from installing Vue globally,
      creating the application in your file directory and creating a full Todo app.
      After completion, vue-router is added to further explain the benefits of using a 
      front-end framework.
