    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>This application was a tutorial with Traversy Media. It is
      thorough in its explanation of Vue.js from installing Vue globally,
      creating the application in your file directory and creating a full Todo app.
      After completion, vue-router is added to further explain the benefits of using a 
      front-end framework.
    </p>

      I like to take a tutorial and add my own spin to it.  I have added local storage for my todo items and have also added 
      additional CSS for background video with a color overlay. I also have used this as an opportunity to work with other 
      CSS units, em and rem;
